# Snake

The goal of the game is to grow your snake to become as big as possible before you lose.
You lose by either biting yourself or by trying to escape and hitting the wall.
You grow your snake by eating the food that shows up randomly everytime you eat it.

NB! add comments that show how the documents link and where to get the website and extra details that will be needed

My goal is to create a snake game with a:
 Black board
 Choice of different levels and also
 options on how to play the game
 Add buttons at the left or bottom then have a high score of previous or have a way to save the game and also options
 Make a drop down menu, with various things to do based on the game
 Have a continue game, next game, highscores, options drop down menu.

In regards to the code, the are different files to allow the game to be changed at a later stage
