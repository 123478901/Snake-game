# Snake

The goal of the game is to grow your snake to become as big as possible before you lose.
You lose by either biting yourself or by trying to escape and hitting the wall.
You grow your snake by eating the food that shows up randomly everytime you eat it.

My goal is to create a snake game with a:
 Black board
 Choice of different levels and also
 options on how to play the game
